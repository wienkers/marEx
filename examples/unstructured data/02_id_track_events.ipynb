    "### `MarEx` Processing Pipeline for Unstructured Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Morphological Pre-Processing**\n",
    "    - Performs binary morphological closing using highly-threaded binary dilation matrix operations to fill small spatial holes up to `R_fill` elements in radius \n",
    "    - Executes binary opening to remove isolated small features of order `R_fill`\n",
    "    - Fills gaps in time to maintain event continuity for interruptions up to `T_fill` time steps\n",
    "    - Filters out smallest objects below the `area_filter_quartile` percentile threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Blob Identification**\n",
    "    - Labels spatially connected components using a highly efficient Unstructured Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) Clustering Algorithm\n",
    "    - Computes blob properties (area, centroid, boundaries)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Tracking**\n",
    "    - Identifies blob overlaps between consecutive time frames\n",
    "    - Connects objects across time, applying the following criteria for splitting, merging, & persistence:\n",
    "        - Connected objects must overlap by at least fraction `overlap_threshold` of the smaller area\n",
    "        - Merged objects retain their original ID, but partition the child area based on the parent of the _nearest-neighbour_ cell (or centroid distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Graph Reduction & Finalisation**\n",
    "    - Constructs the complete temporal graph of object evolution through time\n",
    "    - Resolves object connectivity graph using `scipy.sparse.csgraph.connected_components`\n",
    "    - Creates globally unique IDs for each tracked extreme event\n",
    "    - Maps objects into efficient ID-time space for convenient analysis\n",
    "    - Computes comprehensive statistics about the lifecycle of each event\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline leverages **dask** for distributed parallel computation, enabling efficient processing of large datasets. \\\n",
    "A 40-year global daily analysis at 5km resolution on the _unstructured grid_ (15 million cells) using 240 cores takes ~40 minutes."
